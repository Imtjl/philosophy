## Personal Reflection

**Instructor:** Александр Анатольевич Погребняк

I really enjoyed the lectures and discovered my inner passion for philosophy. 
As an all-rounded generalist, philosophy fits me quite well - 
it connects with so many different areas and levels of knowledge and thinking
and exlain quite alot of life matter. So many ideas, especially Plato's ideas, 
fit the world just right for me (of course with some margin for error), i find it fascinating.
